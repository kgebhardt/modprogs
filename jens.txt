Subject: oneorbit

it differs from the old oneorbit as follows:

- needs halo things (halotables, haloread ...)
- asks for rperi, rapo and v as launch positions
   (instead of iLz, iE and iv; rperi and rapo
   determine Lz and E; v is sin(theta) of the
   intersection with the ZVC; old launching scheme)
- if you give a negative v it asks again, now for
   rperi rapo rstart vr
   again, rperi and rapo determine Lz and E, but
   rstart and vr are the SOS-coordinates of the
   launching point of the orbit
